# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project repository! This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles using various NLP techniques. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant concern in today's digital age. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient model that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake. This will help in mitigating the spread of misinformation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles. Each article is labeled as either real or fake. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## 🔍 Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the code itself.
